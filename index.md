## About Us

Welcome to the homepage of UU-NLP, the Natural Language Processing Group in the [Department of Information and Computing Science](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/). We are a highly interdisciplinary team working on computational models of Natural Language, led by [Albert Gatt](https://albertgatt.github.io/). 

Our work centres around a number of core themes, including:
* Models for automatic text generation and their evaluation;
* Computational methods to study the relationship between [language and society](https://nlpsoc.github.io/);
* Methods to model the interface between language and speech with other modalities, especially vision;
* The challenges of [meaning variation](https://sites.google.com/view/dealingwithmeaningvariation/home) arising from subjective bias, ambiguity and vagueness.

In our research, we collaborate with a broad network of researchers, including colleagues in [Humanities](https://www.uu.nl/onderzoek/institute-for-language-sciences) and the [Social Sciences](https://nlp.sites.uu.nl/). [UU-NLP] forms part of [NLP@U](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/applied-data-science/special-interest-group-text-mining), the UU Joint Special Interest Group in Natural Language Processing.
